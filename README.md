# GeocoderWebApp

Simple Flask Web App that allows the user to input a CSV file with a list of addresses. 
The app then uses geopy to generate the longtiude and latitude locations for each address provided.Finally the app appends these values back
onto the users CSV and allows the user to download the modified file.

Two Sample CSV files are included in the repo. "SampleSet1" and "SampleSet2".
